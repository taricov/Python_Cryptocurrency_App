## Cryptocurrency Web App

This is a streamlit-based web app for displaying data of CryptoCurrencies over 3 different time intervals.
You can filter the shown data as per your requirements using more than 3 filters.
I used beautifulsoup to scrape the data from the web.


* **Python libraries:** *beautifulsoup, base64, pandas, streamlit, matplotlib, Pillow, Json, Time*
